# 8-Input-Bus-Decoder

Decode an 8 bit control bus using a AtTiny84...

Just simple example code to show how to use an AtTiny 84 to watch an 8 bit
control line..Upon recieving an ID matching byte, set one the 4 remaing pin
or in my case send a load pulse to the register pin and an ACK pulse back to 
the controller..
